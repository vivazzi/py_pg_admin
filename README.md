## Installing

1. Open terminal and clone repo anywhere at your home folder.

   git clone https://github.com/vivazzi/py_pg_admin.git
   cd py_pg_admin
   ```

2. (Optional) Copy local_settings_sample.py to local_settings.py and 
   set wished parameters (using your favorite editor). To look available saved pipfiles, input:
   ```shell
   python3 pre_install.py --help
   ```

3. Run pre-installation and follow instructions:
   ```shell
   python3 pre_install.py
   ```

   This command create `.venv` folder in projects folder to virtual environment will be near with project. 
   Also command will try to add `Pipfile` specified in `local_settings.py`, if you did not add `Pipfile` yourself.

   Check your Pipfile (create your own `Pipfile`, if you want to use other pgAdmin) and install packages:
   ```shell
   pipenv sync
   ```

5. Run in terminal:
   ```shell
   sudo python3 post_install.py
